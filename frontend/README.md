This is the frontend application for the real-time Pictionary game. Built with React and TypeScript, it provides the user interface for players to draw, guess, and interact.

## Features

-   **Real-time Drawing Canvas**: What one player draws appears instantly on everyone else's screen.
-   **Chat & Guessing**: An integrated chat box for players to submit guesses.
-   **Pre-game Lobby**: An initial screen prompts players to enter a name before joining the game.
-   **Reactive UI**: The user interface updates in real-time to show the current drawer, the word (or its placeholders), and game notifications.

## Tech Stack

-   TypeScript
-   Tailwind CSS
-   react-scripts (from Create React App)
